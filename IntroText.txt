During the 21st century in Scandinavia,
there lived a person named Jørg Jørgensen,
better known as...

Dethmurder

He practiced guitar in order to create bad
music full of evil.

One day, the wintermoon called upon Dethmurder
to do its bidding.

To fulfill his destiny and become the most
totally brutal mortal of all time, he must
venture forth to the cursed glacier with his
demonic snow shovel, Corpsegrinder.

The Call of the Wintermoon has begun.  The fate
of the world lies with Dethmurder.
